"AIO? Husband tried to choke me but didn't do it ""as forcefully as he could have"" so it doesn't count?","I've been freaking out about this for a while. I keep bringing it up with my husband but he tells me I'm being over dramatic. He also told me it's my fault for mentioning that I wanted to be choked and weeks ago (i meant during sex) Backstory: I was in therapy and embraced with therapist. It was the worst mistake I've ever made. I told my husband and he's been really upset for several months (understandably so). He was having one of his yelling cursing tangents (i let him so that he can get his frustrations out) and sometimes i zone out when it gets to be too much and start scrolling on my phone to get my mind off of what's being said. I stupidly smiled at something I read and he LOST IT. He Jumped on top of me and hit me a few times (no bruises just a light raised mark from his hand) and then put hands arms around my neck. I thought i was going to die for a few seconds but he loosened his grip pretty quickly My husband says I'm ridiculous for being this upset about it. Am I overreacting? He had a good grip on my neck but it didn't really cut off any of my airway or anything. I guess i was just more freaked out than anything and I commonly overreact to things like this. I was contemplating leaving but I don't want to feel like I'm making a spontaneous decision from something that's not that big of a deal. Please answer honestly and with an open mind - maybe it was just playful and I misread it? Preferably Id want to hear from me have been in this situation and was angry but didn't plan on actually hurting your partner"

"WAKE UP: Sheriff Robert Norris Is a Warning of America’s Descent into Fascism","Sheriff Robert Norris didn’t just assault a citizen at a public meeting—he showed America exactly what the future looks like if we don’t fight back against the fascist takeover happening right now. This isn’t just about one sheriff abusing his power. It’s about the rise of authoritarian enforcers who believe they are above the law—a movement fueled by Trumpism, white nationalism, and the complete dismantling of democracy. THE FASCIST PLAYBOOK IS ALREADY IN MOTION Watch the video. This man felt completely comfortable violently grabbing a citizen, threatening her with pepper spray, and trying to drag her out of a public meeting—all while wearing his badge. He didn’t hide it. He didn’t try to justify it. Because he doesn’t think he has to. And why would he? This is exactly how authoritarian regimes start—with small-time power-hungry enforcers testing the limits of what they can get away with. - Banning books: Norris illegally removed books from a public library, deciding he gets to control what people can and cannot read. - Silencing critics: He is being sued for publicly smearing a woman with false accusations—an intimidation tactic straight from the dictator’s playbook. - Aligning with extremists: He’s been spotted at GOP rallies with known white nationalists and far-right extremists. THIS ISN’T A FLUKE. THIS IS A PLAN. TRUMPISM IS TRAINING THESE PEOPLE TO BE HIS FOOT SOLDIERS For years, Trump and his fascist allies have been corrupting law enforcement, the courts, and local governments, planting people like Norris in positions of power so they can act as MAGA enforcers when the time comes. They want sheriffs who ignore the Constitution and police who see political enemies, not citizens. They want judges, mayors, and lawmakers who will punish dissenters and protect their own. This is how it starts. A sheriff gets away with attacking a citizen. Then another bans books. Then another refuses to enforce federal law. Then, suddenly, the law doesn’t apply anymore—unless you’re on their side. THIS IS THE POINT OF NO RETURN—WHAT WILL YOU DO? The worst part of the Norris video? Nobody stopped him. The people in that room sat there and watched a public official assault someone—just like people watched Trump attack democracy, dismantle institutions, and get away with everything. If we keep letting them do this, it will never stop. We are on the edge. If we let this continue, this will be our new reality: - Protesters and critics silenced by force - The Constitution ignored at will - Elections manipulated - Law enforcement turned into a personal militia We have two choices: EXPOSE THEM AND FIGHT BACK, OR LOSE EVERYTHING. - Call these people out—LOUDLY. Share their names. Show the proof. - Vote them out—before voting no longer matters. - Support lawsuits, investigations, and whistleblowers who are trying to stop them. Sheriff Robert Norris is not a fluke. He is the future if we don’t act. This is our warning. And if we ignore it, we will regret it for the rest of our lives."
